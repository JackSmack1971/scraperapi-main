# Security Policy

## Report a Vulnerability

**üîí For security vulnerabilities, please DO NOT open public issues.**

### Preferred Reporting Methods

- **GitHub (Recommended):** Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting via the **Security** tab ‚Üí **"Report a vulnerability"**
- **Email:** security@artofficial-intelligence.com
- **Encryption:** PGP key provided below for sensitive reports

### Response Timeline

- **Initial acknowledgment:** Within 2 business days
- **Status updates:** Weekly until resolution
- **Coordinated disclosure:** Typically 45-90 days from initial report

## Security Scope & Testing Guidelines

### In Scope

‚úÖ **Application Components:**
- Core scraping engine (`scraper.py`)
- GUI application (`ui.py`, `main.py`) 
- Cross-platform utilities (`utils.py`)
- Configuration and environment handling
- File system operations and output handling
- Network request handling and API integrations

‚úÖ **Vulnerability Types:**
- Code execution vulnerabilities
- Authentication/authorization bypasses
- API key exposure or mishandling
- Path traversal attacks
- Input validation failures
- Cross-platform security issues
- Dependency vulnerabilities in `requirements.txt`
- Memory corruption or resource exhaustion

### Out of Scope

‚ùå **Excluded from Bounty/VDP:**
- Denial of Service attacks against external services
- Social engineering attacks
- Physical device access scenarios
- Issues requiring root/admin privileges unrelated to the application
- Third-party service vulnerabilities (ScraperAPI, external websites)
- Browser-based attacks (this is a desktop application)
- Issues in unmaintained dependencies (report to upstream)

### Safe Testing Guidelines

- **Rate limiting:** Please be respectful of ScraperAPI quotas during testing
- **File system:** Test only in isolated directories, avoid system-critical paths
- **Network:** Do not test against sites without permission
- **Data:** Do not attempt to access, modify, or exfiltrate user data
- **Automation:** Limit automated scanning; provide proof-of-concept over volume

## Supported Versions & Security Updates

We provide security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Status | Security Support |
|---------|--------|------------------|
| 1.x.x (current) | ‚úÖ Supported | Full security patches |
| Pre-release | ‚ö†Ô∏è Development | Critical fixes only |
| Dependencies | üìã Tracked | Regular updates via Dependabot |

**Note:** This project is actively maintained. All security patches are applied to the main branch and released as point updates.

## Vulnerability Assessment

### Severity Classification

We use **CVSS v4.0** for vulnerability scoring: [CVSS Calculator](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/4.0)

**Priority Matrix:**
- **Critical (9.0-10.0):** Immediate hotfix within 1-7 days
- **High (7.0-8.9):** Patch within 14 days  
- **Medium (4.0-6.9):** Regular release cycle (30-60 days)
- **Low (0.1-3.9):** Next minor version or documentation update

### Common Attack Vectors for This Project

üéØ **High-risk areas to focus testing:**
- Environment variable handling (`SCRAPER_API_KEY` exposure)
- URL validation and request handling (`validate_url()` function)
- File path construction and directory traversal prevention
- Thread safety in GUI operations (`@mainthread` usage)
- Input sanitization for user-provided URLs
- Cross-platform path handling vulnerabilities
- Logging sensitive information exposure
